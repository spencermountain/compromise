    # Note that these steps are *identical* to build-and-test (with the caveat
    # that build-and-test uses several versions of Node, and Release only uses
    # 10.x) at least until the actual publishing happens.  Ideally, we could
    # delegate to the build- and-test workflow, but I haven't found a way to do
    # that yet.
